## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I can visualize my app and what I want the visuals to look like. Also I can visualize the functionality of my app.


### Weaknesses:

Will mostly use state components compared to props. Still a little mixed up over the two, but I will overcome it.


### Opportunities:

Motivated to continue builing my portfolio. This project can teach me using the foundations we learned and applying it to real life apps.


### Threats:

Lose a lot of time not asking for help.
